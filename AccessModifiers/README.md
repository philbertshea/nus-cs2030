Static is a non-access modifier that is used to enable sharing of keywords without reference to a parent class variable.
This is extremely useful when creating instances of nested classes, without needing to reference to one specific instance of parent classes.
Note that static variables can only access static data/methods and cannot use this or super.
Static can be applied on Variables, Methods, Blocks and Nested Classes. More on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-keyword-java/
