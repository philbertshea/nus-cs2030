My guess is that it cannot compile because class B does not have 
an x variable declared like A.

ERROR IN THINKING: When B extends A, it inherits the variable x as well, therefore
there is no need to re-declare and define x.

We observe that there are no problems with compilation as long as we return instances of a 
type which matches that as declared, or is the subtype of that declared.

E.G. public A method() {return new A} OK
public A method() {return new B} OK since B is a subtype of A
public B method() {return new B} OK
public B method() {return new A} NOT OK.
