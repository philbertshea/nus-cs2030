We use the example of overriding methods. 

If classes A and B have the same method f() defined, and class C inherits from them, 
which of the two parent method will be invoked in new C().f()? 

However for the case of two interfaces A and B, if they both specify f() to be 
defined by a class C that implements them, then an overridden
method in C would satisfy both contracts.

In the case of interfaces with default methods, try compiling the program fragment
below:

interface A {
default void f() { }
}
interface B {
default void f() { }
}
class AB implements A, B { }

Does it compile? What if only one of the interfaceâ€™s f() has a default implementation?
Does it compile now? And what is the compilation error? What if an overriding method
f() is implemented in class AB?
