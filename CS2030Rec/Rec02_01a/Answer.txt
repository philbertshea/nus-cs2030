Only s.getArea() and p.print() are premissible. Suppose Shape s references
an array of objects that implements the Shape interface, so each object is guaran-
teed to implement the getArea method.
Other than that, each object may or may not implement other interfaces (such as
Printable), so s.print() may or may not be applicable.
In addition, we say that for the above statement Shape s = c, variable s has a
compile-time type of Shape but a runtime type of Circle.
